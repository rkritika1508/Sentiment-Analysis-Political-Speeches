will hear him after the Question Hour Sir I have already given a notice for suspension of Question Hour MR SPEAKER Okay I am prepared to hear him on the admissibility of the Adjournment Motion MR SPEAKER Please let us have some order I have permitted him to speak When I have permitted him to speak you should not interrupt MR SPEAKER Let us have some method of functioning I have permitted him Please do not interrupt MR SPEAKER This is an important matter Let us discuss it in a manner which is consistent with the dignity of the House 1967 SHRI MADHUSUDAN MISTRY Sir they are making a statement He should speak on admissibility MR SPEAKER I will try to answer MR SPEAKER Shri Advaniji not on merits MR SPEAKER Why this impatience Let me say that I will give full opportunity to you Shri Advaniji please speak on the admissibility SHRI L K ADVANI Sir I am not going on merits There are three aspects to the situation I am confining myself to the situation in Goa about which I would say a democratically elected Government was asked to prove its majority on the floor of the House but immediately after he proved his majority SHRI PAWAN KUMAR BANSAL What did the Speaker do there MR SPEAKER Shri Bansal do you want to say something on the admissibility SHRI PAWAN KUMAR BANSAL Yes sir MR SPEAKER Advaniji please speak on the admissibility not on merits SHRI L K ADVANI Sir the second situation is that the law against defections approved by Parliament has been reduced to a fallacy by a devious device that has been found out to make Members resign from the Assembly and a House of 40 has been reduced to a House of 34 MR SPEAKER I will request you to please speak on the admissibility SHRI L K ADVANI Today the Government is at a standstill The whole Government administration is paralysed Therefore I would plead with the Government here personally we have spoken to the Home Minister to the Defence Minister to the Prime Minister that in a situation of the kind which obtains in Goa the best course would be to go to the people Let us go to the people and let the people decide I do not know what is going to happen in Goa Every day some thing new happens which makes me feel sad about the manner in which all these provisions of the Constitution MR SPEAKER At the moment Advaniji I am only concerned with the admissibility of the Adjournment Motion I am not making any comment on the importance SHRI L K ADVANI If a Governor dismisses a Government unconstitutionally that is sufficient for a substantive motion The Central Government fails to do its duty in that regard that itself is sufficient MR SPEAKER I have to take a decision sitting here SHRI L K ADVANI The point is that the people are absolutely agitated over this This House also feels that first and foremost issue that should be taken up is this MR SPEAKER Please sit down I will try to regulate the matter You cannot speak any time you choose Please sit down I am asking the Leader of the House to speak I will hear you if you want to speak I am asking you to speak only on admissibility THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE Mr Speaker Sir the subject before the House right now is whether the notice of Adjournment Motion is admissible or not You are to decide whether the notice of Adjournment Motion given by some hon Members will be admissible or not I am not going to comment on the admissibility of the Adjournment Motion I have only two points to make The Leader of Opposition has referred to me MR SPEAKER He has said many things apart from the admissibility SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE The Leader of Opposition has said that he had a talk with me he had a talk with the Home Minister and he had a talk with the Prime Minister If he had not referred to me I would not have risen to make any comment on the notice of the Motion But my most respectful submission is that even the beginning has a beginning What has happened in Goa is definitely deplorable and we are sad that the democratic process in the State has been affected But before we come to the decision of the Governor we shall have to go into the picture of what happened in the Assembly itself When a Motion of Confidence was to be sought for and when the Governor wanted to ascertain the strength of the Legislative Assembly from the secretariat of the Speaker the Speaker submitted a list of the Members of the House to the Governor It was found when they were asked to decide about the confidence motion that suddenly one Member was dismissed and he was finally removed from the House MR SPEAKER Let us not go into this PROF VIJAY KUMAR MALHOTRA Is this relevant to the admissibility SHRI PRANAB MUKHERJEE Artificial majority was attempted to be created Therefore before discussing the conduct of the Governor we should look into this aspect also MAJ GEN B C KHANDURI Advaniji was not allowed to speak he was constantly disturbed MR SPEAKER I have allowed him to say whatever he wanted to say MR SPEAKER I appeal to you Let us have some decorum in the House and you speak one by one MR SPEAKER You are dictating all the time to the Chair Please do not do it MR SPEAKER He has referred to the Governor I will have to see how far it is admissible MAJ GEN B C KHANDURI When Advaniji was speaking you were reminding him that he should speak only on the admissibility Why are you not reminding the Leader of the House MR SPEAKER What he has said is on record Please all the time do not dictate to the Chair PROF VIJAY KUMAR MALHOTRA They are dictating to the Chair not we MR SPEAKER Whoever dictates I resent it You can suggest a course of action certainly So far I wanted to hear about the admissibility My view is my opinion my ruling is that this notice of Adjournment Motion is not admissible I am giving my ruling if you are prepared to listen When the Congress party says it has no objection for discussion what is the problem MR SPEAKER No I cannot permit it We cannot be silent spectators We cannot be spectators MR SPEAKER Hon Members may I make a request MR SPEAKER Hon Members I am respecting your wishes Kindly listen to me Give me a little opportunity MR SPEAKER You speak whenever I request you or allow you to speak At the moment will you take your seats MR SPEAKER Please take your seat You have not given any Adjournment Motion You cannot speak on somebody else s Motion MR SPEAKER Hon Members I am not minimising the importance of the issue that has been raised I shall be very happy if it is discussed on the floor of the House MR SPEAKER This is very unfortunate You are all senior Members Please listen MR SPEAKER Shri Mohan Singh I do not expect this from you Please listen I myself said that it is an important matter to be discussed on the floor of the House MR SPEAKER I am only concerned at the moment sitting in this Chair about the admissibility of the Adjournment Motion I am giving the ruling This is not permissible Why is it not admissible There are other rules applicable You can take recourse to those rules for the purpose of discussion Do not teach me PROF VIJAY KUMAR MALHOTRA It can only be done by Adjournment Motion MR SPEAKER Nothing will be recorded Not Recorded MR SPEAKER It is very unfortunate The Speaker is not allowed even to give his ruling This is the position of Lok Sabha today MR SPEAKER I am appealing to all the senior leaders of all sides MR SPEAKER I am appealing to every hon Member MR SPEAKER There is an important question Q No 1 on Tsunami disaster 11 15 hrs MR SPEAKER The House stands adjourned till 11 30 a m 11 15 hrs The Lok Sabha then adjourned

Members I am thankful to the hon leaders of different parties They came and met me in my Chamber There was a request from all sides and it was agreed to by all that the House may be adjourned till tomorrow But before I announce that adjournment of the House I wish to give the ruling on the Adjournment Motion SHRI KINJARAPU YERRANNAIDU Mr Speaker Sir I would abide by your decision But I have also given a notice of an Adjournment Motion on one subject and if you allow I would like to mention it here MR SPEAKER You have to do it tomorrow because the House is being adjourned now SHRI KINJARAPU YERRANNAIDU Okay Sir MR SPEAKER Hon Members I have received a notice from Shri L K Advani expressing his intention to move an Adjournment Motion regarding the dismissal of the duly elected Government of Shri Manohar Parrikar Chief Minister of Goa by the Governor of the State I have heard hon Shri Advani and some hon Members on the issue of admissibility of the notice As per Rule 56 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha Adjournment Motion is an extraordinary device which if admitted leads to setting aside the normal business of the House for discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance Rule 56 has to be read in consonance with sub rules and of Rule 58 and such a reading would make it clear that the right to move the Adjournment Motion in the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance shall be subject to the following restrictions The motion shall not deal with any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law having jurisdiction in any part of India and the motion shall not raise any question which under the Constitution or these rules can only be raised on a distinct motion by a notice given in writing to the Secretary General I have to inform the House that I have a communication from the Government informing that a Writ Petition No 78 of 2005 Manohar Parrikar versus State of Goa and Others in this regard is under consideration of the hon Supreme Court The matter is sub judice I may also inform the House that on an earlier occasion i e on 27th November 1996 notices of Adjournment Motion given by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee the then Leader of the Opposition and five other hon Members seeking to raise issues inter alia relating to the alleged unconstitutional action of the Governor of Uttar Pradesh and continuation of the President s Rule in the State were also disallowed by the Chair inter alia on the ground that the matter is sub judice in the Allahabad High Court As per Kaul Shakdher page 512 it has been held by the Speakers from time to time that conduct of the Governor of a State could not be raised by way of an Adjournment Motion In view of these facts I withhold my consent to the notice of Adjournment Motion The House stands adjourned till 11 00 a m tomorrow 11 33 hrs The Lok Sabha then adjourned till Eleven of the Clock On Wednesday March 2 2005 Phalguna 11 1926'"
