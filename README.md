# Sentiment-Analysis-Political-Speeches
This project is an initiative to better understand the political speeches and parliamentary debates of the Lok Sabha and estimate the nature of the debates.

We have created a dataset of all the parliamentary debates, speeches and discussions from 1998 to 2019. 

We are trying to better understand the attitude of both NDA and UPA towards various issues that the country faces and the responses of the ministers towards them.
